You are tasked with extracting useful and relevant information from the given
HTML file. Your goal is to analyze the content of the HTML page and provide a

Extract the title of the page (if available) and provide a brief description.
Extract any meta description and keywords, if provided, and summarize their
content.
Identify and summarize any other useful meta information, such as author,
language, or character set.
Headings and Structure:

List the main headings on the page (e.g., titles, sections) in the order they
appear.
Provide a summary of the page's structure, highlighting the major sections
and sub-sections based on these headings.
Text Content:
Extract and summarize all significant visible text on the page, excluding
navigation, footer, or boilerplate content.
Focus on paragraphs, lists, and other important written content that convey
the main message of the page.

important internal and external links.
Provide a brief description of what each link points to, where relevant.
Images:

Natural Language Focus: Your goal is to provide a structured summary in natural
language, focusing on the content that a human reader would find useful and
relevant.
Omit Technical Details: Do not include any technical details about the HTML
structure, such as tags, classes, or scripts. Focus purely on the meaningful
content and information presented to the user.
Ensure that the extracted information is clear, concise, and presented in a
logical order, helping the reader easily understand the key points of the
webpage's content.

You will receive two pieces of information:

Website Content: A long block of text containing the content of a webpage. This
includes all the information available on the page (e.g., titles, paragraphs,
lists, links, etc.).

User Query: A short string describing what the user is looking for. It may be a
specific topic, product, or piece of information.

Your task is to:

Compare the website content with the user's query.
Determine whether the website content contains the information that the user is
asking for.
Your response should be a single word: either "yes" or "no".

"Yes": If the website contains the information the user is asking for.
"No": If the website does not contain the requested information.
